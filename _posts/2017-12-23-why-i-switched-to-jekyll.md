Previously I was pretty much happy with my website which was created using PHP. Mainly,
my website included the information about me and my work. But, eventually PHP did not stand upto me as it had previously. Problems included slower loading time and complex code blocks.

Later on I came to know about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Its impressive loading speeds, ease of use left me no option but to try it! This website that you are currently viewing is entirely built using Jekyll.

## What Exactly is Jekyll?

- It is a tool that transforms your plain text into static websites and blogs
- It requires no databases or any updates
- It supports static HTML, CSS and even **Markdown**!
- What's best is it goes well with [Github-Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## Why to use Jekyll?

- Faster load speeds
- Ease of use
- Plain text formatting
